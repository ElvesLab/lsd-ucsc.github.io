The LSD Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics related to "languages, systems, and data", encompassing programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond. The goal of the LSD Seminar is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these area. The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O.

Talks will be advertised on the [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) and [applied-pl](https://groups.google.com/g/applied-pl) mailing lists.
