The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For winter 2022, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar on Zoom, but local folks can gather in person in the lab to tune into the Zoom talks together, assuming in-person meetings are allowed.

Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

**Title:** Append is Near: Log-based Data Management on ZNS SSDs

**Abstract:** Log-based data management systems use storage as if it was an append-only medium in order to transform random writes into sequential writes, delivering a major advantage when logs were persisted on hard disks. Although solid-state drives (SSDs) offer improved random write capabilities, sequential writes continue to be advantageous due to locality and space efficiency. However, the inherent properties of flash-based SSDs induce significant disadvantages when utilizing a random write block interface, causing write amplification, uneven wear, log stacking, and garbage collection overheads. To eliminate these disadvantages, Zoned Namespace (ZNS) SSDs have recently been introduced. They offer increased capacity, reduced write amplification, and higher performance but require the host to participate in data placement through zones, which have sequential-write semantics and must be explicitly reset. In ZNS, the Zone Append primitive allows the host to push down fine-grained data placement onto the device, supporting appends to a zone without knowing the location of the tail. Full zones become immutable, greatly simplifying disaggregated storage and operations like replication.

We propose another pushdown technique, Group Append, which allows appends of data that is smaller (or possibly larger) than a block, offloading data buffering to the controller. We explore how ZNS SSDs with Zone Append, Group Append, and computational storage can benefit four log-based data management areas: (i) log-based file systems, (ii) LSM trees such as RocksDB, (iii) database systems, and (iv) event logs/shared logs. We also propose research directions for all four log-based data management using ZNS SSDs.

**Bio:** Dev is a PhD candidate in the Computer Science department at University of California Santa Cruz. His research interests lie in storage systems, operating systems and distributed systems, and programming languages. Dev completed his Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) in India. At UCSC he has been working on improving the lifetime of low cost, low reliability SSDs and evolving systems for Zoned Namespace SSDs. Dev has been an Engineering Intern at Riverbed Networks (2017), and an Architecture Enabling Intern at SK Hynix America Ltd. (2019).

**Speaker:** Max Willsey

**Title:** What's up with E-Graphs?

**Abstract:** E-graphs are an important data structure inside SMT solvers, but recently they have been used for a whole lot more, including optimization, program synthesis, and verification!

This talk will give a whirlwind introduction to e-graphs and equality saturation, as well as some new algorithms that make them faster. I'll also introduce [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/), a toolchain that packages all this up into a generic, reusable library. Then, we'll move on to some applications of these new techniques, including floating point accuracy, 3D CAD, deep learning, and more. Finally, I'll talk about some of the current work folks are using egg for, including a teaser for our [upcoming POPL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02290) that connects e-graphs to databases.

**Bio:** [Max](https://www.mwillsey.com/) is a postdoc at the University of Washington in the [PLSE](http://uwplse.org/) group, where he also did his PhD. His main line of work is on [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/), an e-graph and equality saturation toolkit.
