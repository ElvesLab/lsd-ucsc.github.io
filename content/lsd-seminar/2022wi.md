The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For winter 2022, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar on Zoom, but local folks can gather in person in the lab to tune into the Zoom talks together, assuming in-person meetings are allowed.

Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

**Title:** Append is Near: Log-based Data Management on ZNS SSDs

**Abstract:** Log-based data management systems use storage as if it was an append-only medium in order to transform random writes into sequential writes, delivering a major advantage when logs were persisted on hard disks. Although solid-state drives (SSDs) offer improved random write capabilities, sequential writes continue to be advantageous due to locality and space efficiency. However, the inherent properties of flash-based SSDs induce significant disadvantages when utilizing a random write block interface, causing write amplification, uneven wear, log stacking, and garbage collection overheads. To eliminate these disadvantages, Zoned Namespace (ZNS) SSDs have recently been introduced. They offer increased capacity, reduced write amplification, and higher performance but require the host to participate in data placement through zones, which have sequential-write semantics and must be explicitly reset. In ZNS, the Zone Append primitive allows the host to push down fine-grained data placement onto the device, supporting appends to a zone without knowing the location of the tail. Full zones become immutable, greatly simplifying disaggregated storage and operations like replication.

We propose another pushdown technique, Group Append, which allows appends of data that is smaller (or possibly larger) than a block, offloading data buffering to the controller. We explore how ZNS SSDs with Zone Append, Group Append, and computational storage can benefit four log-based data management areas: (i) log-based file systems, (ii) LSM trees such as RocksDB, (iii) database systems, and (iv) event logs/shared logs. We also propose research directions for all four log-based data management using ZNS SSDs.

**Title:** What's up with E-Graphs?

**Abstract:** E-graphs are an important data structure inside SMT solvers, but recently they have been used for a whole lot more, including optimization, program synthesis, and verification!

This talk will give a whirlwind introduction to e-graphs and equality saturation, as well as some new algorithms that make them faster. I'll also introduce [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/), a toolchain that packages all this up into a generic, reusable library. Then, we'll move on to some applications of these new techniques, including floating point accuracy, 3D CAD, deep learning, and more. Finally, I'll talk about some of the current work folks are using egg for, including a teaser for our [upcoming POPL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02290) that connects e-graphs to databases.

**Bio:** [Max](https://www.mwillsey.com/) is a postdoc at the University of Washington in the [PLSE](http://uwplse.org/) group, where he also did his PhD. His main line of work is on [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/), an e-graph and equality saturation toolkit.

**Title:** Simulating spacecraft: Not exactly rocket science

**Abstract:** Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) operates a fleet of autonomous spacecraft across our solar system. For more than thirty years, operators have validated planned activities against a simulated model of their spacecraft in order to preserve these valuable resources. These models are typically implemented in a domain-specific language (a DSL), which is then interpreted for an execution plan by reusable simulation systems.

As we make our spacecraft even more intelligent, our spacecraft models become correspondingly more complex. Existing simulation systems were designed with a minimal DSL and limited scope, and have been significantly expanded under a constant flow of feature requests. Unfortunately, this has led to simulation systems and models that are difficult to understand and maintain without relying on global reasoning and deep expertise.

[Merlin](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/) is a newly open-sourced simulation system under development at JPL. Merlin models are written in plain Java, which we try to make as "uninteresting" as possible for modelers. Instead, we spend our "novelty budget" mostly under the hood. This talk will showcase the concurrency semantics supporting local reasoning in Merlin, and some of the techniques we take to keep Merlin out of the way.

**Bio:** [Jonathan Castello](https://jonathan.com/) is a software engineer most recently with Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he worked on both modern and legacy ground software for spacecraft operations. His research interests sit at the nexus of modular design, concurrency, and monotonic state.

**Title:** A Strong Approach to Testing Weak Memory Models

**Abstract:** GPUs are increasingly being used for compute workloads that require interactions between threads using shared memory. Like many CPUs, GPUs expose weak memory models that allow for more aggressive compiler and hardware optimizations at the expense of a more complex programming model. Testing these memory models is an ongoing line of research.

This talk will detail our ongoing project on testing GPU memory models. First, we will show a motivating example from an optimized renderer and illustrate how we can reason about the synchronization in the renderer using classic weak memory model litmus tests. Next, we will overview recent work on testing GPU memory models, including complex heuristics necessary to reveal weak behaviors in testing. Our new work builds on this existing work in several ways: (1) we provide a simple DSL and a compiler for expressing litmus tests and testing heuristics; we currently have backends for Vulkan and WebGPU. (2) A new parallel execution model for litmus tests, which allows tests to be executed an order of magnitude faster than in prior works. (3) A web application interface for running litmus tests through WebGPU. We will conclude with a discussion on how these contributions might lead to more robust testing methodologies and hope to facilitate discussions on how they relate to conformance testing.

**Bio:** Reese Levine is a second year PhD student at UC Santa Cruz advised by Tyler Sorensen. He is interested in research in parallel, concurrent, and distributed systems, and his work currently focuses on testing weak memory models in GPUs.

**Speaker:** Kostis Kaffes

**Title:** Syrup: User-Defined Scheduling across the Stack

**Abstract:** Suboptimal scheduling decisions in operating systems, networking stacks, and application runtimes are often responsible for poor application performance, including higher latency and lower throughput. These poor decisions stem from a lack of insight into the applications and requests the scheduler is handling and a lack of coherence and coordination between the various layers of the stack, including NICs, kernels, and applications. We propose Syrup, a framework for user-defined scheduling. Syrup enables untrusted application developers to express application-specific scheduling policies across these system layers without being burdened with the low-level system mechanisms that implement them. Application developers write a scheduling policy with Syrup as a set of matching functions between inputs (threads, network packets, network connections) and executors (cores, network sockets, NIC queues) and then deploy it across system layers without modifying their code. Syrup supports multi-tenancy as multiple co-located applications can each safely and securely specify a custom policy. We present several examples of uses of Syrup to define application and workload-specific scheduling policies in a few lines of code, deploy them across the stack, and improve performance up to 8x compared with default policies.

**Bio:** Kostis Kaffes is a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, advised by Christos Kozyrakis. He is broadly interested in computer systems, cloud computing, and scheduling. His thesis focuses on end-host, rack-scale, and cluster-scale scheduling for microsecond-scale tail latency. Recently, he has been looking for ways to make it easier to implement and deploy custom scheduling policies across different layers of the stack. Kostis's research has been supported by a Facebook Research Award and various scholarships and fellowships from Stanford, A.G. Leventis Foundation, and Gerondelis Foundation. Prior to Stanford, he received his undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens in Greece.
