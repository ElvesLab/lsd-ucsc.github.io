The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For spring 2022, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar on Zoom, but local folks can gather in person in the lab to tune into the Zoom talks together, assuming in-person meetings are allowed.

Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

**Speaker:** Olivia Hsu

**Title:** Compilation of Sparse Array Programming Models

**Abstract:** This talk explains how to compile sparse array programming languages. A sparse array programming language is an array programming language that supports element-wise application, reduction, and broadcasting of arbitrary functions over dense and sparse arrays with any fill value. Such a language has great expressive power and can express sparse and dense linear and tensor algebra, functions over images, exclusion and inclusion filters, and even graph algorithms. This talk describes our compiler strategy, which generalizes prior work in the literature on sparse tensor algebra compilation to support any function applied to sparse arrays, instead of only addition and multiplication. To achieve this, we generalize the notion of sparse iteration spaces beyond intersections and unions. These iteration spaces are automatically derived by considering how algebraic properties annotated onto functions. We then show how to compile these iteration spaces to efficient code.

**Bio:** Olivia is a computer science PhD student at Stanford University advised by Professor Kunle Olukotun and Professor Fredrik Kjolstad. She currently works on mapping sparse applications to domain-specific architectures, reconfigurable dataflow hardware, and accelerators through the TACO compiler. Her research interests broadly include computer architecture, computer and programming systems, compilers, programming models and languages, and digital circuits/VLSI.

**Title:** Resilient and Scalable Architecture for Permissioned Blockchain Fabrics

**Abstract:** Since the introduction of Bitcoin—the first widespread application driven by blockchains—the interest in the design of blockchain-based applications has increased tremendously. At the core of these blockchain applications are consensus protocols that aim at securely replicating a client request among all replicas, even if some replicas are Byzantine faulty. Unfortunately, modern consensus protocols either yield low throughput or face design limitations.
In this work, we present the design of three consensus protocols that facilitate efficient consensus among the replicas. Our protocols help to scale consensus through the principles of phase-reduction, parallelization, and geo-scale clustering while ensuring no compromise in fault-tolerance. Further, we believe that the focus on consensus protocols is only one-side of the story. Specifically, we present the design of a well-crafted permissioned blockchain fabric (ResilientDB) that can help even a slow consensus protocol outperform a faster protocol. Our results indicate that it is easy to scale BFT protocols to hundreds of replicas and achieve throughputs of the order 350K txns/s.

**Bio:** Suyash Gupta is a postdoctoral researcher at the RISELab, University of California, Berkeley. He is also the Lead Architect of ResilientDB fabric. Prior to joining RISELab, he received his Ph.D. degree from University of California, Davis. He also holds two Master of Science degrees; one from Purdue University and another from Indian Institute of Technology Madras. His current research focuses on attaining safe and efficient, fault tolerant distributed consensus and communication. He has also co-authored a book on fault-tolerant distributed transaction processing at Morgan & Claypool. In his free time, Suyash likes to code and has won awards at several hackathons.

**Speaker:** Amanda Liu

**Title:** Verified Tensor-Program Optimization Via High-Level Scheduling Rewrites

**Abstract:** We present a lightweight Coq framework for optimizing tensor kernels written in a pure, functional array language. Optimizations rely on user scheduling using a series of verified, semantics-preserving rewrites. Unusually for compilation targeting imperative code with arrays and nested loops, all rewrites are source-to-source within a purely functional language. Our language comprises a set of core constructs for expressing high-level computation detail and a set of what we call reshape operators, which can be derived from core constructs but trigger low-level decisions about storage patterns and ordering. We demonstrate that not only is this system capable of deriving the optimizations of existing state-of-the-art languages like Halide and generating comparably performant code, it is also able to schedule a family of useful program transformations beyond what is reachable in Halide.   

**Bio:** Amanda Liu is a second year PhD student working with Prof. Adam Chlipala and Prof. Jonathan Ragan-Kelley. Her interests are using formal methods and programming languages to develop verified, principled methods for writing high-performance systems.

# April 22

**Speaker:** Will Crichton

**Title:** Modular Information Flow Through Ownership

**Abstract:** Statically analyzing information flow, or how data influences other data within a program, is a challenging task in imperative languages. Analyzing pointers and mutations requires access to a program's complete source. However, programs often use pre-compiled dependencies where only type signatures are available. We demonstrate that ownership types can be used to soundly and precisely analyze information flow through function calls given only their type signature. From this insight, we built Flowistry, a system for analyzing information flow in Rust, an ownership-based language. In this talk, I will describe how Flowistry works, how we prove its soundness, and how we show that the ownership-based modular approximation does not lose much precision versus a whole-program analysis.

**Bio:** Will Crichton is a 6th year PhD student at Stanford University advised by Profs. Pat Hanrahan and Maneesh Agrawala. His research combines cognitive psychology and programming language theory to understand how people program, and to design better tools for programmers.
