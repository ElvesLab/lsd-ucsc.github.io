The LSD Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O.

For winter 2021, this seminar is completely virtual and will feature a mix of internal and external speakers.

Talks will be advertised on the [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) and [applied-pl](https://groups.google.com/g/applied-pl) mailing lists, or contact [Lindsey](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/) or [Tyler](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/) for Zoom meeting details.

**Title:** Dialectic: Pragmatic, Efficient Session Types for Async Rust

**Abstract:** Session types have long promised the ability to enforce complex temporal invariants about message ordering in distributed systems, guaranteeing that a well-session-typed program always correctly follows a messaging protocol to its end. Despite their potential, these type systems have seen relatively little adoption in the mainstream. In part, this is due to their inherent reliance on linear typing, a feature not present and difficult to emulate in most popular languages. Recently, this has changed with the emergence of Rust, a systems programming language built atop a flexible "ownership type system" to track reference aliasing. Although Rust enforces in actuality a form of affine typing (weaker than the linear typing most formal session-typed calculi require) it's enough to build a library for session types that statically enforces the slightly-weaker guarantee that a program correctly follows a messaging protocol so long as it is running, but may quit the session early. Of course, this is the best we can hope to get in the real world! Networks go down, computers crash, and hardware just plain breaks. For session types to be broadly adopted, they must survive contact with this real and unpredictable world—and equally, with the real and unpredictable people who want to use them in their programs.

I've just released version 0.2 of [Dialectic](https://docs.rs/dialectic): a library for pragmatic, succinct, efficient session types in Rust. Dialectic embraces Rust's burgeoning ecosystem of high-performance async networking by being polymorphic over any backend transport used to convey messages between parties. Unlike many libraries for session types, Dialectic assumes that the other party might break protocol or disconnect at any time, and is designed to gracefully handle such failures without compromising type safety.  Dialectic is designed to be used for writing specifications and programs of every size from small to large, and provides what's needed to write modular specifications and implementations of complex protocols—and not merely the regular session types expressible in most libraries, but all context-free session types.

More than merely showing off this cool thing I'm working on, I want to talk about the design process that went into making it. Designing a programming paradigm—whether you want to call it an embedded domain-specific language or merely a library—is a multi-faceted puzzle spanning considerations from psychological familiarity to formal computability. My hope is that in walking through this case study in embedded language design, we can spark more thoughts about how we as PL researchers can play in this field together and design beautiful, useful tools.

**Title:** TransForm: Formally Specifying Transistency Models and Synthesizing Enhanced Litmus Tests

**Abstract:** Memory consistency models (MCMs) have been formulated as a mechanism for expressing the legal ordering and visibility of shared memory accesses in hardware and software. They are fundamental for ensuring heterogeneous components of a system execute and interact as expected to prevent hardware-induced bugs in real-world programs. However, ISA-level MCMs are limited to defining the behavior of only user-facing assembly instructions and do not account for virtual memory implementations that may result in the execution of 1) hardware-level state updates and 2) system-level interactions. Both are capable of accessing memory and may affect program outcomes, thus making them software-visible. As a result, memory transistency models (MTMs) have been coined as a superset of MCMs to additionally capture and enforce virtual memory-aware ordering rules. However, no prior work enabled the formal specification or analysis of MTMs.

TransForm fills this gap by introducing an axiomatic vocabulary for formally specifying MTMs that builds on the standard axiomatic vocabulary traditionally used for describing MCMs. It provides new constructs for modeling transistency-specific features such as hardware-level state updates and system-level interactions. Using this new axiomatic vocabulary, MTMs can be formally specified and used with TransForm’s synthesis engine to synthesize litmus tests enhanced with transistency features, called enhanced litmus tests. This talk will cover TransForm’s axiomatic vocabulary and synthesis engine, as well as a case study performed with TransForm to formally define an approximate MTM for Intel x86 processors.

**Title:** On the Design, Implementation, and Use of Laziness in R

**Abstract:** In this talk, I will present the design and implementation of call-by-need in R, and a data-driven study of how generations of programmers have put laziness to use in their code. In our study, we analyze 16,707 R packages and observe the creation of 270.9 B promises. Our data suggest that there is little supporting evidence to assert that programmers use laziness to avoid unnecessary computation or to operate over infinite data structures. For the most part R code appears to have been written without reliance on and in many cases even knowledge of, delayed argument evaluation. The only significant exception is a small number of packages which leverage call-by-need for meta-programming. I will discuss how we intend to leverage these insights to remove laziness from R and enable non-intrusive migration of code from lazy to eager evaluation.

**Bio:** Aviral Goel is a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, advised by Professor Jan Vitek. He received his Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, India.

He is interested in improving tools and techniques for data science applications. He is enabling R programmers to write faster and bug-free code by migrating the language from lazy-by-default to lazy-on-demand semantics. 

He is also involved in the development of a type system for R.

**Title:** Parallelizing Sequential Code with Compiler-Hardware Co-Design

**Abstract:** Today, most code still runs on expensive, power-hungry processors that prioritize single-thread performance. Speculative parallelization is an enticing approach to accelerate computation while retaining the ease of sequential programming, by launching tasks in parallel before knowing if they are independent. Unfortunately, prior speculative parallelizing compilers and architectures achieved limited speedups due to high costs of recovering from misspeculation and hardware scalability bottlenecks.

We present T4, a parallelizing compiler that executes sequential programs as trees of tiny timestamped tasks. T4 targets the recent Swarm architecture, which presents new opportunities and challenges for automatic parallelization. T4 introduces novel compiler techniques to expose parallelism aggressively across the entire program, breaking applications into tiny tasks of tens of instructions each. Task trees unfold their branches in parallel to enable high task-spawn throughput while exploiting selective aborts to recover from misspeculation cheaply. T4 exploits parallelism across function calls, loops, and loop nests; performs new transformations to reduce task spawn costs and avoid false sharing; and exploits data locality among fine-grain tasks. As a result, T4 scales several hard-to-parallelize SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks to tens of cores, where prior work attained little or no speedup.

**Bio:** Victor Ying is a 5th year PhD student at MIT, advised by Daniel Sanchez. He works on parallel architectures, compilers, and programming models. Victor's recent work focuses on redesigning abstractions between hardware and software to make it as easy to exploit multicore parallelism as it is to write ordinary sequential programs. His prior work includes Boolean satisfiability solvers, scheduling machine learning workloads on hardware accelerators, and embedded and distributed systems.
