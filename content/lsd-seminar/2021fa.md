**Organizers**: Lindsey Kuper and Tyler Sorensen <br />

The Languages, Systems, and Data Seminar meets weekly to discuss interesting topics in the areas of programming languages, systems, databases, formal methods, security, software engineering, verification, architecture, and beyond.  Our goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in these areas.  The seminar is open to everyone interested.  Participating UCSC students should register for the 2-credit course CSE 280O (let the organizers know if you're an undergrad and need a permission code).

For fall 2021, we will continue to host the LSD Seminar on Zoom, but local folks can gather in person in the lab to tune into the Zoom talks together.

Talks will be advertised on the [ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/ucsc-lsd-seminar-announce) (for anyone) and [lsd-group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/g/lsd-group/members) (for UCSC-affiliated people) mailing lists.

**Title:** Cheaper (& correct) blockchain protocols and programs

**Abstract:** We will explore how we can make it cheaper to run blockchain protocols and programs---while guaranteeing correctness!

For cheaper protocols, we move from a block*chain* to a block*graph*. Such a blockgraph, which we show to be a reliable point-to-point link, is built together by a set of servers. Thereby, the servers embed many parallel runs of a deterministic protocol into it. And because the protocol is deterministic, every server can locally replay the protocol---and no more messages need to be sent [1]!

For cheaper programs, we super-optimize bytecode of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which runs on many servers to execute programs on the blockchain. Now, to avoid the halting problem, every executed bytecode costs money. So we have a clear optimization target---money---and we use an automated theorem prover to synthesize cheaper, observationally equivalent, programs [2].

**Bio:** [Maria A Schett](https://maria-a-schett.net/) is currently finishing her PhD on "Cost Reduction With Guarantees: Formal Reasoning Applied To Blockchain Technologies" at University College London. She loves living in London and talking about blockchains, distributed systems, and compilers. She is conversational in term rewriting and qualitative research (from a previous life) and in Esperanto.
