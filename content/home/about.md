The **Languages, Systems, and Data (LSD) Lab** at UC Santa Cruz is a loosely organized federation of [CSE](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) students, researchers, and faculty, working in programming languages, systems, databases, and the intersections of those areas.  We aim to cultivate a community where all these research traditions can intermingle and benefit from one another.
