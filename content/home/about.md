# About us

The **Languages, Systems, and Data (LSD) Lab** at UC Santa Cruz is a loosely organized federation of people and research groups working in **programming languages** (semantics, design, implementation, ...), **systems** (especially decentralized and distributed systems), **data management** (databases, storage systems), and the intersections of those areas.
